# Physics 272
This repository is an incomplete collection of calculators for various problems applied in Physics 272: Electric and Magnetic Interactions.

It includes a rudimentary vector class for calculations including 3D vectors, as well as functions that calculate the electric field of 
various objects at a given reference point (disks, rings, rods, etc.).

This repository is not meant for cheating of any kind- it is to be used strictly to make calculations less tedious.
